# Zomato-Data-Analysis
Hello, Github community

I’m excited to share a recent project where I used Python and Python libraries to Zomato Dataset

Analyzed Zomato's restaurant dataset to uncover key insights into restaurant ratings, pricing, and popular cuisines across different cities, using Python’s powerful data analysis and visualization libraries.

**Technologies Used**:

Pandas: For data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.

NumPy: For numerical computations and efficient data handling.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating visually appealing and insightful data visualizations.


**Key Highlights of the Project**:

Data Cleaning and Preparation: Cleaned the raw data by handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing duplicates to ensure accurate analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Used Pandas and NumPy to explore the dataset, identify trends, and summarize key metrics such as average ratings, cost for two, and the distribution of restaurant types.


**I recently had the opportunity to dive deep into some advanced Python questions, and I wanted to share my visualization with my network:**
