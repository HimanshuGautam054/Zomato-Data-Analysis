# Zomato-Data-Analysis
Hello, Github community

I’m excited to share a recent project where I used Python and Python libraries on Zomato Dataset

Analyzed Zomato's restaurant dataset to uncover key insights into restaurant ratings, pricing, and popular cuisines across different cities, using Python’s powerful data analysis and visualization libraries.

**Technologies Used**:

**Pandas:** For data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.

**NumPy:** For numerical computations and efficient data handling.

**Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For creating visually appealing and insightful data visualizations.


**Key Highlights of the Project**:

**Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Cleaned the raw data by handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing duplicates to ensure accurate analysis.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Used Pandas and NumPy to explore the dataset, identify trends, and summarize key metrics such as average ratings, cost for two, and the distribution of restaurant types.


**I recently had the opportunity to dive deep into some advanced Python questions, and I wanted to share my visualization with my network:**
**Q1)** What type of restaurant do the majority of customers order from?

**Q2)** How many votes has each type of restaurant received from customers?

**Q3)** What are the ratings that the majority of restaurants have received?

**Q4)** Zomato has observed that most couples order most of their food online. What is their
average spending on each order?

**Q5)**  Which mode (online or offline) has received the maximum rating?
